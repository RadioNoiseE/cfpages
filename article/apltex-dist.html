  <h2 id="c1">1. Why Build a New TeX Distribution</h2>
  <p><em>Finally</em> I decided to build my own TeX distribution<sup><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>, as the current TeXLive
  (even the minimal installation) is too bloated for me. All I need is a basic TeX compiler and a compact directory
  containing the files TeX reads in. I use Type1 fonts, but I certainly don't need a command line tool to generate font
  maps for me. <code>ls-R</code> database is unnecessary unless there are <em>many</em> files under the directory
  Kpathsea searches<sup><a href="#f2">2</a></sup>. Strictly speaking, I also don't need LaTeX2e.</p>
  <h2 id="c2">2. My Choice</h2>
  <p>I chose LuaTeX as the TeX engine. While it doesn't come with many fancy features out of the box, its functionality
  can be greatly extended using the embedded Lua scripting language. As the successor to Omega/Aleph, LuaTeX greatly
  enhances vanilla TeX's multilingual typesetting capabilities. A build-in graphic library <code>mplib</code> is
  included, which eliminates the need for TikZ and such.</p>
  <p>The default format is plainTeX, which I found much easier to work with compared to LaTeX2e. It doesn't involve
  many high-level abstractions (i.e., NFSS2 for font selection), making it more straightforward. It also doesn't
  uselessly try to separate format and content, which is really useless when doing <em>non-trivial</em> typesetting.
  There are some drawbacks though, such as a less active community.</p>
  <h2 id="c3">3. Construction</h2>
  <h3 id="s3-1">3.1. Web2C (Kpathsea)</h3>
  <p>The main focus here is on optimizing compile-time and runtime path configuration. This is where I modified the
  standard TDS. In addition to optimizing file scanning, I removed support for engines other than LuaTeX and eliminated
  support for most helper scripts.</p>
  <h3 id="s3-2">3.2. Engine (LuaTeX)</h3>
  <p>Nothing special here. I simply compiled LuaTeX inside TeXLive's source tree (and its banner remains) with
  HarfBuzz. I had tried embedding LuaJIT, but seems like it is incompatible with so many Lua-based macro-packages (like
  <code>luaotfload</code>).</p>
  <h3 id="s3-3">3.3. Fonts and Format</h3>
  <p>The basic installation includes only the Type1 and TFM for Computer Modern and all fonts included in the AMSFonts
  bundle. You can use them with the good old ways. In further versions, the Concrete Math font might be included.</p>
  <p>To use OpenType or TrueType fonts, you will need <code>luaotfload</code>, a font loader adapted from ConTeXt for
  plainTeX. This is bundled in the <code>dist.tar.gz</code> which is released with <span class=
  "term">aplTeX</span>.</p>
  <p>The default format is plainTeX, which has been patched in a way to utilize the extensions of eTeX, pdfTeX, and
  LuaTeX. It is also Unicode-aware. Additionally, I've added an <code>\everyjob</code> hook so that LuaTeX will read
  <code>luatex.map</code><sup><a href="#f3">3</a></sup>.</p>
  <h2 id="c4">4. Dist Release</h2>
  <p>The poor man's version doesn't come with any macro-packages â€” only plainTeX. I believe external macro-packages are
  generally unnecessary for plainTeX, except in a few cases.</p>
  <p>For these rare cases, I've packaged a few macro-packages. These are mainly for demonstration purposes (showing how
  the modified TDS works), and to handle some of the complex dependencies (many of which weren't even documented). The
  packaged ones include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>luamplib</code>, which offers a convenient way to use LuaTeX's <code>mplib</code> for plotting.</li>
    <li><code>luaotfload</code>, which is the plainTeX migration of the ConTeXt font loader, making it easier to work
    with OTF fonts.</li>
    <li><code>luatexja</code>, which provides high-quality CJK typesetting support.</li>
  </ul>
