  <h2 id="c1">1. Background</h2>
  <p>After roughly 2 months wait, my IBM Beam Spring keyboard reproduction from Model F Labs finally arrived. I opted
  for the Round 1 version because I like the Space Saver compact case which is not available in the Round 2 products,
  though they have arguably better QC and a press fit top which eliminates quiet a few minor issues when tuning each
  module.</p>
  <p>Satisfied with the hardware, I was eager to see what I could do to reveal the true power of its built-in
  controller, and that’s exactly where this article begins.</p>
  <div class="tip">
    <p>Don’t forget to check out <a href="https://ldbeth.sdf.org/articles/qmk.html">this article</a> written by LdBeth.
    The author is also grateful for his invaluable guidance in addressing numerous issues encountered.</p>
  </div>
  <h2 id="c2">2. Vial or QMK</h2>
  <p>The keyboard comes with the pre-flashed Vial firmware, which is a QMK fork for <q>configuring your keyboard in
  real time</q>. Sounds good, but what are the costs? It stores all configurable options into the 1kb EEPROM, including
  your keyboard layout. This makes the storage rather limited, restricting you to just 3 layers and 10 macros.</p>
  <p>Despite that, you miss out on those fancy features that are only available in the latest QMK, like dynamic macros,
  deferred execution, and more. If you want more granularity, QMK is the clear choice. Anyway, there’s not much to gain
  from the real-time configuring capabilities, especially when your configuration is settled.</p>
  <h2 id="c3">3. Where to Start</h2>
  <h3 id="s3-1">3.1. QMK Environment</h3>
  <p>In the best situations, your package manager might have packaged QMK for you. However, for me on Darwin using
  pkgsrc, things started to get a bit more complicated. For this specific keyboard, I needed <code>avr-gcc</code> which
  is part of the AVR MCU toolchain available on Microchip’s website<sup><a href="#f1">1</a></sup> and
  <code>dfu-programmer</code> for flashing firmware.</p>
  <h3 id="s3-2">3.2. Obtaining Patches</h3>
  <p>Fortunately, Purdea Andrei has worked on an old QMK fork which provides support for wcass<sup><a href=
  "#f2">2</a></sup> controllers. We should use the <code>9e92bbf</code> commit. Essentially, these patches override the
  default matrix initialize and scan function for capacitive sensing.</p>
  <h2 id="c4">4. Customization</h2>
  <p>After successfully building your very first QMK firmware, you should assign a key for <code>QK_BOOT</code>. This
  will save you from having to unscrew 12 screws and open the back-lid just to short <code>PROG</code> to enter the
  bootloader for flashing.</p>
  <p>In fact, no substantial modification to the patch or to the QMK side is required, though the userspace for QMK has
  changed a lot. <code>qmk lint</code> will guide you through updating the legacy <code>config.h</code> and
  <code>rules.mk</code>. When incorporating the new features like boot magic, keep SRAM usage in mind or you will
  soft-brick your controller.</p>
  <p>The only thing that doesn’t work is the raw hid, which I chose to drop. Thus, to squeeze space for those more
  useful features, some global variables solely used by it can be declared local. Note that the Pandrew utility can no
  longer be used, so make sure your keyboard is detecting the signals beforehand.</p>
